# pandas-challenge

## Problem
For this assignment we were required to provide a multi-angled approach to presenting two large datasets of information. The datasets provided were about school and student information.

## Execution Notes
In order to acheive the desired results, I had to make use of multiple instance of different DataFrames and had to continuously rename and reorder them. I believe this has an adverse effect on the speed of execution and the amount of overhead used by this script. In the future, I would like to find a more elegant way to acquire the same information.

## Limitations
This script takes a second or so to run in entirety. I do not doubt this can be sped up with better allocation of memory and optimizing Pandas functionality.
