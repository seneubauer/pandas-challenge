### Observable Trend #1
From the School Type breakdown table, it is plainly visible that Charter schools outperform District schools in reading and math scores. These scores are reflected in the notably higher passing percentages for Charter schools. This observation is backed up by the comparison between the top five schools vs the bottom five schools. The top five are all Charter schools while the bottom five are all District schools.

### Observable Trend #2
From the School Size breakdown table, it is visible that smaller schools tend to have higher performing students than their larger school counterparts. This supports the idea that a smaller student body allows for students to have more 'teacher time' than in large school bodies. It is generally accepted that more 'teacher time' increases student success. A good way to confirm this hypothesis is to include the teacher quantity and teacher reviews in this analysis.

## Observable Trend #3
It appears the correlation between school budget and student success is not present. The total budget does not follow an obvious trend when compared between successful and unsuccessful schools. Even when accounting for budget per student, the amount of money does not follow an obvious trend. Due to the obvious importance of budgets, especially for public schools, it would be beneficial to look further into this phenomena.
